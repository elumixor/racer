##### About

**Racer** is a course project for computer architecture course. This work aims to develop an application
for [MicroZed](http://microzed.org/product/microzed) board. Due to remote development, user interaction is
done through the console.

##### Vision

**[Racer is a simple racing game](./docs/vision.md)**, where the player controls
a car and has to evade obstacles. Player scores points as he manages to stay on the racing track and not crash.
[(More in docs)](./docs/vision.md)

##### Architecture

The program is written in C++, with parts of C, containing low-level board-interaction. 
**[Architecture](./docs/architecture.md)** was somewhat inspired by Unity and
OpenGL, those familiar with it might find some resemblance.
